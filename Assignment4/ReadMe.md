Explain how web browsers function:
The user interface is presented, displays an address bar and other elements. The rendering engine displays a web page. The browser engine directs actions between user interface and rendering engine and external communication with servers. The browser communicates over the network for necessary images and documents. Java script applies interactive logic and functionality to a website. Interpreters translate for different browsers. Data storage helps to remember information.
