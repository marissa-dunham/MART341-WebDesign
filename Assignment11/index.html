        <p>On April 26, 1986 in Chernobyl, Ukraine, the Number Four RBMK reactor at the nuclear power plant exploded. This accident was a result of a flawed reactor design and inadequately trained workers. 30 operators and firemen were killed within three months and several decades after the explosion.</p>
