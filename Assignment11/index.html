        <p>On April 26, 1986 in Chernobyl, Ukraine, the Number Four RBMK reactor at the nuclear power plant exploded. This accident was a result of a flawed reactor design and inadequately trained personnel. 30 operators and firemen were killed within three months and several decades after the explosion. The explosion released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the environment and many parts of Europe. Around 5000 thyroid cancers were reported as a result from the atomic radiation.</p>
