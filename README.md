        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
        <p>Take me out tonight<br />
        Where there's music and there's people<br />
        And they're young and alive<br />
        Driving in your car<br />
        I never, never want to go home<br />
        Because I haven't got one<br />
        Anymore
        </p>
        <p>Take me out tonight</p>
        Because I want to see people<br />
        And I want to see life<br />
        Driving in your car<br />
        Oh, please don't drop me home<br />
        Because it's not my home, it's their home<br />
        And I'm welcome no more
        </p>
        <p>And if a double-decker bus</p>
        Crashes into us<br />
        To die by your side<br />
        Is such a heavenly way to die<br />
        And if a ten ton truck<br />
        Kills the both of us<br />
        To die by your side<br />
        Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
        </p>
        <p>Take me out tonight</p>
        Take me anywhere, I don't care<br />
        I don't care, I don't care<br />
        And in the darkened underpass<br />
        I thought, Oh God, my chance has come at last<br />
        But then a strange fear gripped me<br />
        And I just couldn't ask
        </p>
        <p>Take me out tonight</p>
        Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care<br />
        I don't care, I don't care<br />
        Driving in your car<br />
        I never, never want to go home<br />
        Because I haven't got one, la di dum<br />
        Oh, I haven't got one<br />
        Oh, oh
        </p>
        <p>And if a double decker bus</p>
        Crashes into us<br />
        To die by your side<br />
        Is such a heavenly way to die<br />
        And if a ten ton truck<br />
        Kills the both of us<br />
        To die by your side<br />
        Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
        </p>
        <p>Oh, there is a light and it never goes out</p>
        There is a light and it never goes out<br />
        There is a light and it never goes out<br />
        There is a light and it never goes out<br />
        There is a light and it never goes out<br />
        There is a light and it never goes out<br />
        There is a light and it never goes out<br />
        There is a light and it never goes out
